QUEST FOR EUTOPIA
=================
(run main.exe to play)
======================================================================================================

ABOUT:
======
Step into the office of Serbian president and get your country out of debt and into EUTOPIA.


While this is definitely a politically driven game, one should not read too much into our 
oh so subtle political satire, for this is, after all, a game of skill and Diablo-style mouse
destruction, and definitely not a result of deep pondering on current Serbian politics.



The political ideology represented in this game is a product of merging of two opposed political
currents, present in Serbian political scene since the age of founding of Balkan national states
- the pro-Western political ideology and the anti-Western political ideology. In the last few
decades, Serbian mainstream politics have adopted a view similar to the one shown in this game
- one that claims that West is the only rational way to go, but that necessary transition is very
painful and risky process.



This game shows us a dystopian world in which no price is too high for enterance into the utopian
version of The European Union.

HOW TO PLAY:
============
It's time to sell everything and pay our huge national debts!
Bribe your ministers in order to get their permission to sell buildings from their domain, and
don't forget to play the Kosovo card as soon as it is available! It will give you a lot of money,
but for a period of time, Kosovo will not be a part of Serbia, and that means you can not sell it
again untill it is.
Bribe your ministers often, or they will get angry and thus expensive. Nobody likes to be neglected.
If you are good to your ministers, they will allow you to sell the most advanced structures from
their ministry's jurisdiction.
Also be sure to pay your debts in time, because the EU banks will increase their interest if you
don't pay them back regularily. Use the blue button in top right corner.
If you're lucky, you can find special items on your map. Giving up mob bosses to the Interpol or
capturing war criminals for the international courts is as profitable as selling your athletes to
foreign sports teams or exporting young minds to foreign universities. You can even profit from
national treasure and historical monuments. If you don't know what it is, it must be worth at least
something. If you find Santa, sell him too!
